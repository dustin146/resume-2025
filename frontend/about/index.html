        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm Dustin Umphress, an AWS Certified Solutions Architect with over 10 years of experience in IT operations and systems administration. I've spent the majority of my career in healthcare IT environments, where I've managed everything from Microsoft 365 tenants to multi-terabyte data migrations and workflow automation.</p>

        <p>My path into tech wasn't traditional. I started in medical billing operations in 2015, but quickly found myself drawn to the technical side—troubleshooting EMR systems, building SQL reports, and eventually taking on full IT administration responsibilities. Over the years, I transitioned from operations into systems administration, and more recently, into cloud infrastructure and automation.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I specialize in building cost-efficient, automated cloud infrastructure with a focus on reliability and operational simplicity. My recent work includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> Designing and deploying AWS architectures using EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, and IAM. I've migrated production websites to AWS Lightsail with zero downtime and built serverless applications that reduced operational costs by 70%.</li>
          <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Building Python-based automation tools, SQL reporting workflows, and integration pipelines using Make.com and n8n. One recent project reduced manual data entry by 42%.</li>
          <li><strong>Microsoft 365 Administration:</strong> Managing enterprise M365 tenants, including Entra ID (Azure AD), conditional access policies, MFA implementation, and large-scale migrations from Dropbox to SharePoint with custom permission structures.</li>
          <li><strong>Infrastructure Optimization:</strong> Redesigning IT infrastructure for cost efficiency—one project achieved a 94% cost reduction through strategic cloud migration and resource optimization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Focus</h2>
        <p>I'm actively pursuing opportunities in cloud engineering, DevOps, and infrastructure automation. I recently earned my AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification (December 2024) and am continuing to build hands-on experience through personal projects and infrastructure work.</p>

        <p>My goal is to transition fully into cloud-focused roles where I can apply my operational experience and technical skills to build scalable, resilient infrastructure. I'm particularly interested in companies that value practical problem-solving and cost-conscious engineering.</p>
